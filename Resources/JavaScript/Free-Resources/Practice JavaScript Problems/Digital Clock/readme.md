"How can you create a real-time digital clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where the time updates every second using the Date object, and the display is styled to look like a modern digital clock?"

üìù Short Description for README
This project demonstrates how to build a live digital clock in the browser using JavaScript. The clock retrieves the current hours, minutes, and seconds from the built-in JavaScript Date object and updates automatically every second using setInterval(). The design is styled with CSS to resemble a sleek digital clock.
